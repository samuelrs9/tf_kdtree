    This function implements a simple KNN computation by comparing all
    points in the two point clouds points_ref and points_query. Note that
    this operation is quadratic in time, but linear in memory.

    Parameters
    ----------
    points_ref : tensor or array of float or double precision
        Points in which the KNNs will be searched
    points_query : tensor or array of float or double precision
        Points which will search for their KNNs
    nr_nns_searches : int, optional
        How many closest nearest neighbors will be queried (=k), by default 1

    Returns
    -------
    tuple
        Returns the tuple containing

        * dists (tensor of float or double precision) : Quadratic distance of KD-Tree points to the queried points
        * inds (tensor of type int) : Indices of the K closest neighbors
